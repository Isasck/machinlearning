the model you use, the tokenization process could be different.\n","\n","For example, one model might turn `\"I love pizza\"` into `[40, 3021, 23317]`, where as another model might turn it into `[101, 1045, 2293, 10733, 102]`.\n","\n","To deal with this, Hugging Face models often pair models and tokenizers together by name.\n","\n","Such is the case with [`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased) (there is a `tokenizer.json` file as well as a `tokenizer_config.json` file which contains all of the tokenizer implementation details).\n","\n","For more examples of tokenization, you can see OpenAI's [tokenization visualizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) as well as their open-source library [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken), Google also have an open-source tokenization library called [`sentencepiece`](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece), finally Hugging Face's [`tokenizers`](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library is also a great resource (this is what we'll be using behind the scenes).\n","\n",":::\n","\n","Many of the text-based models on Hugging Face come paired with their own tokenizer.\n","\n","For example, the [`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased) model is paired with the `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased` tokenizer.\n","\n","We can load the tokenizer for a given model using the [`transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#auto-classes) method and passing it the name of the model we'd like to use.\n","\n","The `transformers.AutoTokenizer` class is part of a series of Auto Classes (such as `AutoConfig`, `AutoModel`, `AutoProcessor`) which automatically loads the correct configuration settings for a given model ID.\n","\n","Let's load the tokenizer for the `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased` model and see how it works.\n","\n",":::{.callout-note}\n","\n","Why use the `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased` model?\n","\n","The short answer is that I've used it before and it works well (and fast) on various text classification tasks.\n","\n","It also performed well in the [original research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) which introduced it.\n","\n","The longer answer is that Hugging Face has many available open-source models for many different problems available at [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models).\n","\n","Navigating these models can take some practice.\n","\n","And several models may be suited for the same task (though with various tradeoffs such as size and speed).\n","\n","However, overtime and with adequate experimentation, you'll start to build an intuition on which models are good for which problems.\n","\n",":::"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":336,"referenced_widgets":["64674168b55546f09d544e55d9c43bf1","afec544d660e4ea59635fabb54767ada","15da16b12ede4b9b8aac85e548e7e382","ebc6d522e83143c8b928e7eaf53286d0","493662b166f242269e19c34529b3acbf","7ab6653954d443e585b70da69c24cd74","73ae9e14f11044748f16503ef34c8ab7","9fc84f759ef74bfbb62d6820408d6622","b9e4e28d48734a5ba8bbd702f2ccddd2","9331cc0bca104ca6a5147d3e2bbec8ba","dbb826d70ef040fca66420a78402b353","53ec578aff94482ea814514c8e50a2ef","930dd24dcfe743458a10a2722b9093d9","014d53bafebc4095882daaece1dd016e","e29af868eff449e5947bf90f5b67174e","229e37c4d6054b23b68f379fbbda6226","368d9fbef22f46a9b3608b997f20b487","2691d7a80e1d4399889900d966bf499d","9fd7db99437e4fc69136616fd4faa9f4","6a0a491086c043be8cca52f75f5c8c94","4988a396c5bc420bbcbe365908efd273","7b50f290f2bd4c24a4e9ede1e3160cff","e17ce62145ac436da0c025f05ef18a36","fe915057f5f348f8834b2ab2e8a4c1cc","bbf39000c3224f2b9e92449ee4508967","84154ed6c6954e3eb3d9bd1db9221d2f","67ca658273a8405a808d75724cc9d110","d9e390b7b6b24baaa77c30eed07018d5","b4db4bf057e249ea9d30a81ec07b7828","e5d3c3fd574f45c4900182c9463ed56b","487b39b76fc24db1ae6ee755c33c6f24","7f10f4505765409d8e787084e1d706b1","dc18ee9c50be47ebb7aff68aab18a577","df968bb1c1dd41f6b4dba7e743f4f0c4","69bcc2ba4492414891172b9e1441821f","3143b144fee84531867490b96e78cdfb","38e55160f26d49f788b7c1b9f6b00661","c62476c07b634714b36d2f7acba53f6b","be633e317e334ecc817a3397f97cb935","c06db04934e94668b48d7c7f8da37898","bcbaaec965b84f219c04a5d9772d9a4d","f26ab5e3a63240848116dbe0dbcceaaf","43f79099c9bf43d3b95c66c783f8d1e0","cfbb632ca8e84596b255d5773805436e"]},"id":"EfFLh-Sw4ifl","outputId":"757c3502-d129-45cf-fd89-64420a0d9132","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741950679648,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1661,"user":{"displayName":"Isaac

ready for training!\n","\n","We're up to step 3 of our process:\n","\n","1. ✅ Create and preprocess data.\n","2. ✅ Define the model we'd like use with [`transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification) (or another similar model class).\n","3. Define training arguments (these are hyperparameters for our model) with [`transformers.TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments).\n","4. Pass `TrainingArguments` from 3 and target datasets to an instance of [`transformers.Trainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer).\n","5. Train the model by calling [`Trainer.train()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.40.2/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer.train).\n","6. Save the model (to our local machine or to the Hugging Face Hub).\n","7. Evaluate the trained model by making and inspecting predctions on the test data.\n","8. Turn the model into a shareable demo.\n","\n","The `transformers.TrainingArguments` class contains a series of helpful items, including hyperparameter settings and model saving strategies to use throughout training.\n","\n","It has many parameters, too many to explain here.\n","\n","However, the following table breaks down a helpful handful.\n","\n","Some of the parameters we'll set are the same as the defaults (this is on purpose as the defaults are often pretty good), some such as `learning_rate` are different.\n","\n","| Parameter | Explanation |\n","|:-----|:-----|\n","| `output_dir` | Name of output directory to save the model and checkpoints to. For example, `learn_hf_food_not_food_text_classifier_model`.  |\n","| `learning_rate` | Value of the initial learning rate to use during training. Passed to [`transformers.AdamW`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments). Initial learning rate because the learning rate can be dynamic during training. The ideal learning is experimental in nature. Defaults to `5e-5` or `0.00001` but we'll use `0.0001`.  |\n","| `per_device_train_batch_size`| Size of batches to place on target device during training. For example, a batch size of `32` means the model will look at 32 samples at a time. A batch size too large will result in out of memory issues (e.g. your GPU can't handle holding a large number of samples in memory at a time). |\n","| `per_device_eval_batch_size` | Size of batches to place on target device during evaluation. Can often be larger than during training because no gradients are being calculated. For example, training batch size could be 32 where as evaluation batch size may be able to be 128 (4x larger). Though these are only esitmates. |\n","| `num_train_epochs` | Number of times to pass over the data to try and learn patterns. For example, if `num_train_epochs=10`, the model will do 10 full passes of the training data. Because we're working with a small dataset, 10 epochs should be fine to begin with. However, if you had a larger dataset, you may want to do a few experiments using less data (e.g. 10% of the data) for a smaller number of epochs to make sure things work. |\n","| `eval_strategy` | When to evaluate the model on the evaluation data. If `eval_strategy=\"epoch\"`, the model will be evaluated every epoch. See the documentation for more options. **Note:** This was previously called `evaluation_strategy` but was shortened in `transformers==4.46`. |\n","| `save_strategy` | When to save a model checkpoint. If `save_strategy=\"epoch\"`, a checkpoint will be saved every epoch. See the documentation for more save options. |\n","| `save_total_limit` | Number of total amount of checkpoints to save (so we don't save `num_train_epochs` checkpoints). For example, can limit to 3 saves so the total number of saves are the 3 most recent as well as the best performing checkpoint (as per `load_best_model_at_end`). |\n","| `use_cpu` | Set to `False` by default, will use CUDA GPU (`torch.device(\"cuda\")`) or MPS device (`torch.device(\"mps\")`, for Mac) if available. This is because training is generally faster on an accelerator device. |\n","| `seed` | Set to `42` by default for reproducibility. Meaning that subsequent runs with the same setup should achieve the same results. |\n","| `load_best_model_at_end` | When set to `True`, makes sure that the best model found during training is loaded when training finishes. This will mean the best model checkpoint gets saved regardless of what epoch it happened on. This is set to `False` by default. |\n","| `logging_strategy` | When to log the training results and metrics. For example, if `logging_strategy=\"epoch\"`, results will be logged as outputs every epoch. See the documentation for more logging options. |\n","| `report_to` | Log experiments to various experiment tracking services. For example, you can log to Weights & Biases using `report_to=\"wandb\"`. We'll turn this off for now and keep logging to a local directory by setting `report_to=\"none\"`. |\n","| `push_to_hub` | Automatically upload the model to the Hugging Face Hub every time the model is saved. We'll set `push_to_hub=False` as we'll see how to do this manually later on. See the documentation for more options on saving models to the Hugging Face Hub. |\n","| `hub_token` | Add your Hugging Face Hub token to push a model to the Hugging Face Hub with `push_to_hub` (will default to [`huggingface-cli login`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/cli) details). |\n","| `hub_private_repo` | Whether or not to make the Hugging Face Hub repository private or public, defaults to `False` (e.g. set to `True` if you want the repository to be private). |\n","\n","::: {.callout-note}\n","\n","To get more familiar with the `transformers.TrainingArguments` class, I'd highly recommend [reading the documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) for 15-20 minutes.

Our text classification model works on `food`/`not_food` text samples. How would you create your own binary text classification model on different classes?\n","    * Create ~10 or samples of your own text classes (e.g. 10 samples each of `spam`/`not_spam` emails) and retrain a text classification model.\n","    * Bonus: Share the model you've made in a demo just like we did here. Send it to me, I'd love to see it! My email is on [my website](https://www.mrdbourke.com).\n","2. We've trained our model on two classes (binary classification) but how might we increase that to 3 or more classes (multi-class classification)?\n","    * Hint: see the `num_labels` parameter in `transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification`.\n","3. Our model seems to work pretty good on our test data and on the few number of examples we tried manually. Can you find any examples where our model fails? For example, what kind of sentences does it struggle with? How could you fix this?\n","    * Hint: Our model has been trained on examples with at least 5-12 words, does it still work with short sentences? (e.g. \"pie\").\n","    * Bonus: If you find any cases where our model doesn't perform well, make an extra 10-20 examples of these and add them to the dataset and then retrain the model (you'll have to lookup [\"how to add rows to an existing Hugging Face dataset\"](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/how-do-i-add-things-rows-to-an-already-saved-dataset/27423)). How does the model perform after adding these additional samples?\n","4. Datasets are fundamental to any machine learning project, getting to know how to process and interact with them is a fundamental skill. Spend 1 hour going through the [Hugging Face Datasets tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/tutorial).\n","    * Write 5 things you can do with Hugging Face Datasets and where they might come in handy.\n","5. The Hugging Face `transformers` library has many features. The following readings are to help understand a handful of them.\n","    * Spend 10 minutes exploring the [`transformers.TrainingArguments` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments).\n","    * Spend 10 minutes reading the [`transformers.Trainer` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/trainer#trainer).  \n","    * Spend 10 minutes reading the Hugging Face [model sharing documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_sharing).  \n","    * Spend 10 minutes reading the Hugging Face [`transformers.pipeline` documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines#pipelines).  \n","        * What does a `pipeline` do?\n","        * Name 3 different kinds of pipelines and describe what they do in a sentence\n","6. Gradio is a powerful library for making machine learning demos, learning more about it will help you in future creations.
